### Components

- **User Interface**: Facilitates interaction between the user and the agent, handling input and displaying responses.
- **Main Controller (`main.py`)**: Orchestrates the flow of data, managing user inputs, invoking the agent, and handling outputs.
- **Agent Core (`agent.py`)**: The heart of the assistant, responsible for processing queries, managing tool executions, and maintaining session state.
- **Generative Model (`generative_model.py`)**: Interfaces with language models to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.
- **Tool Manager (`tools/`)**: A collection of tools that extend the agent's capabilities, including:
  - **User Input Tool**: Handles enhanced user input, supporting multiline entries.
  - **Shell Command Tool**: Executes shell commands and returns outputs.
  - **File Manager**: Manages file reading, writing, and directory listing.
  - **Web Scraping Tools**: Utilize BeautifulSoup for parsing web content.
  - **Search Tools**: Interface with DuckDuckGo and Wikipedia for fetching information.
  - **Display Tools**: Render content with rich formatting for better user experience.
- **Response Parser (`response_xml_parser.py` & `response_parser.py`)**: Parses and validates responses generated by the agent.
- **Models (`models/`)**: Define data structures for handling responses, tools, and configurations.
- **Logging**: Implements comprehensive logging using the `rich` library for enhanced visibility and debugging.

## Features

- **Multiline User Input**: Allows users to input multi-line queries, enhancing the depth and clarity of interactions.
- **Integrated Tools**: A suite of tools for executing shell commands, managing files, scraping web content, and performing searches.
- **Rich Logging and Display**: Utilizes the `rich` library to provide colorful and structured logs, panels, and formatted outputs.
- **Configurable Generative Models**: Supports various language models with customizable parameters like temperature and token limits.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable with additional tools and features due to its modular architecture.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms to ensure smooth and uninterrupted user experiences.
